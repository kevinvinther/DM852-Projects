# ASG1

The documentation for the functions can be found in the headerfiles. The documentation in the C++ file is more specific to code that may be confusing. Time complexity is to be found in the header file along with the documentation.
The test files use a macro #define TEST, which is simply a short way to write a cassert statement. 

The code passes all the tests, both on Dalila and the user-made.
