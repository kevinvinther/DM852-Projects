# ASG1

The documentation for the functions can be found in the headerfiles. The documentation in the C++ file is more specific to code that may be confusing. Time complexity is to be found in the header file along with the documentation.
The test files use a macro #define TEST, which is simply a short way to write a cassert statement. 

The code passes all the tests, both on Dalila and the user-made.

## Test files
The test files are split into multiple files testing mainly one function. However, this does not mean that the function is only tested in this file. You will find tests of functions not in the file dedicated to the function.
You can run all the tests by using `Make` and running `./runTests` inside the `asg1` folder.
